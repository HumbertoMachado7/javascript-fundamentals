# JavaScript Fundamentals Exercises

This repository contains a collection of basic exercises and code examples covering fundamental concepts in JavaScript. These exercises were completed as part of a learning journey to solidify core programming principles.

## Topics Covered

Each file corresponds to a specific concept or exercise. Here's a list of the topics included, reflecting the learning path:

1.  `01valores.js`: Understanding different data types and values.
2.  `02variables.js`: Working with variables and declarations (var, let, const).
3.  `03funciones.js`: Defining and using functions.
4.  `04scope.js`: Exploring variable scope (global, local, block).
5.  `05hosting.js`: Explaining the concept of hoisting.
6.  `06coercion.js`: Demonstrating type coercion (implicit and explicit).
7.  `07truthyFalsy.js`: Identifying truthy and falsy values.
8.  `08OpAsigCompArit.js`: Using arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators.
9.  `09if.js`: Implementing conditional logic with `if` statements.
10. `10stonePaperSisor.js`: A basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game implementation.
11. `11switch.js`: Implementing conditional logic with `switch` statements.
12. `12stonePaperSisors_Switch.js`: Rock-Paper-Scissors using `switch`.
13. `13stonePaperSisor_Ternario.js`: Rock-Paper-Scissors using the ternary operator.
14. `14Arrays.js`: Working with arrays and common array operations.
15. `15loop_For.js`: Using `for` loops for iteration.
16. `16loop_While.js`: Using `while` loops for iteration.
17. `17objects.js`: Working with objects and object properties.
18. `17objects.test.js`: (Assuming this is a test file) Unit tests for object manipulation examples.
19. `18funcionConstructora.js`: Exploring constructor functions.
20. `18funcionConstructora.test.js`: (Assuming this is a test file) Tests for constructor functions.
21. `19creandoListaAuto.js`: Example of creating a dynamic list (e.g., with loops/arrays).
22. `19creandoListaAuto.test.js`: (Assuming this is a test file) Tests for list creation.
23. `20funcion_Constructora.js`: Further example/practice with constructor functions.
24. `20funcion_Constructora.test.js`: (Assuming this is a test file) Tests for constructor functions.
25. `21metodos_Recorrido_Arrays.js`: Using array iteration methods (map, filter, reduce, etc.).
26. `21metodos_Recorrido_Arrays.test.js`: (Assuming this is a test file) Tests for array iteration methods.
27. `22ejercicio1.js`: General exercise file 1.

## How to Run the Code

You can run these JavaScript files using Node.js:

1.  Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2.  Clone this repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/HumbertoMachado7/javascript-fundamentals-exercises.git`
3.  Navigate into the repository directory:
    `cd javascript-fundamentals-exercises`
4.  Run any exercise file using `node` (e.g., run `node 01valores.js`). For files that might require a web browser environment, you'd need to adapt (or mention it in the README).
5.  If any files have dependencies listed in `package.json`, run `npm install` first.
6.  To run test files (ending in `.test.js`), you typically need a test runner like Jest or Mocha and a command like `npm test` (if configured in `package.json`).
